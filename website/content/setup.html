<h1>Setting Up Your Computer</h1>
<p><i>One option for this class is to sign-up and use
<a href="http://wakari.io">Wakari</a>, a browser-based Python cloud-computing
interface, rather than your own computer.  It contains all the tools we'll
need for the course.</i></p>

    <h2>Hardware and Software</h2>
    <p>It is important that each student has a laptop or other computer to
      use during the course.  Though it is possible to use a Windows machine,
      a Unix-based architecture (such as Mac OSX or Linux) will make your
      life much easier, both for this course and in the long run.</p>
    <p>There are two primary software requirements for this course:
      <b>Python</b> and <b>Git</b>, which is a very useful version control
      system.  Details on installation can be found below.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another possibility is to do all work online, using a
      <a href="http://wakari.io">Wakari</a> account.  This will allow you
      to work with Python entirely in your browser, with commands executed
      on the cloud, skipping the installation steps outlined below.</p>

    <h2>Installing Python</h2>
    <p>The most important piece of software to have is Python.  In this
      course we will be using <b>Python 2.7.5</b>, though any version
      2.6.x-2.7.x should work.  Note that you <b>should not use Python 3.x</b>
      at this point: 3.x has slightly different syntax, and will not work for
      this course.</p>
    <h3>Packages</h3>
    <p>In addition to the Python interpreter, a number of scientific packages
      will be required:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.numpy.org">NumPy</a> version 1.5+:
	efficient array operations</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.scipy.org">SciPy</a> version 0.11+:
	scientific computing tools</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a> version 1.0+:
	plotting and visualization</li>
      <li><a href="http://ipython.org">IPython</a> version 1.0+:
	interactive computing</li>
      <li><a href="http://scikit-learn.org">Scikit-learn</a> version 0.12+:
	machine learning</li>
      <li><a href="http://nose.readthedocs.org/">Nose</a>: unit testing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>For installation from-scratch, I highly recommend the
      <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda Installer</a>, a free product offered by ContinuumIO.  It gives you a fast local Python
      installation with up-to-date packages.<p>
      <ol>
	<li>Download and install Anaconda on your system, by going to the
	  above link, downloading the appropriate package, and then typing
	  <pre>[~]$ bash Anaconda-1.x.x-Linux-x86.sh</pre>
	  (substitude the package you downloaded above).
	</li>
	<li><b>Open a new terminal window</b>, and make sure your $PATH
	  variable points to the Anaconda installation. You can do this by
	  typing <pre>[~]$ which python</pre>
	  The result should show the path to the newly-installed anaconda
	  folder.  If not, you must modify your $PATH variable to point to
	  the anaconda directory.
	<li>Update your Anaconda distribution by typing
	  <pre>[~]$ conda update conda</pre>
	  Conda is the package management system that comes with anaconda.
	</li>
	<li>Update your IPython installation to version 1.0 using
	  <pre>[~]$ conda update ipython</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Check whether your IPython notebook is working correctly: type
	  <pre>[~] ipython notebook</pre>
	  and a browser window should open to the notebook dashboard.
      </ol>
    <p>More detailed system-specific help can be found on the Anaconda
      <a href="http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html">
	installation page</a>.
    <p>Even if you have an existing Python installation, I'd still recommend
      installing Anaconda for this course.  It will make your life a lot
      easier.</p>

    <h2>Installing Git</h2>
    <p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> can be installed rather easily
      on OSX or linux.  Detailed instructions can be found
      <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">
	here</a></p>
      <h3>Linux</h3>
      <p>If you are on linux, you can use the package management system, via
      <pre>[~]$ sudo apt-get install git</pre>
      or
      <pre>[~]$ yum install git-core</pre>
      </p>

      <h3>Mac OSX</h3>
      <p>On Mac OSX, you can either use the Mac installer at
      <pre>http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer</pre>
      or if you use Macports, type
      <pre>[~]$ sudo port install git-core</pre>
      </p>

      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <p>Git can be installed on windows using the tools at
	<a href="http://msysgit.github.com/">http://msysgit.github.com/</a>.
	Make sure to get the command-line interface as well as the GUI
	interface.</p>

    <h2>Downloading the Course Material</h2>
    <p>When you're finished installing Git, you can download all the course
      material (including the HTML source of this web page) by typing
      <pre>[~]$ git clone  https://github.com/jakevdp/2014_fall_ASTR599.git</pre>
      This will create a new folder and download all the course material.
      If you ever would like to update the files in this folder, simply
      type
      <pre>[~]$ cd /path/to/2014_fall_ASTR599<br>[~]$ git pull</pre>
      We will introduce the Git workflow more completely during the 
      bootcamp.
