    <h2>Introduction to Scientific Computing in Python</h2>
    <p>ASTR 599 is an introduction to the concepts of scientific computing
      using the Python programming language, and the Scipy ecosystem,
      including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, IPython, and other related packages.

    <h2>Course Goals</h2>
    <p>This course is aimed at incoming graduate students who have some
      experience with scientific computing, but who are not necessarily
      familiar with the Python programming language.  We will assume that
      before starting the course, students have some experience with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using the terminal for simple tasks (i.e. you should be familiar
	with <i>ls</i>, <i>cd</i>, <i>pwd</i>, <i>mv</i>, and other basic
	shell commands)</li>
      <li>Writing simple scripts in a modern programming language such as
	Python, IDL, MatLab, Mathematica, C, Fortran, etc. (i.e. you should
	be familiar with variables, functions, for loops, while loops, and
	if-else statements in some language, not necessarily Python)</li>
      <li>Students who don't meet this basic background are encouraged to
	spend some time preparing for the course.  A basic shell tutorial
	can be found <a href="http://www.freeos.com/guides/lsst/">here</a>,
	while list of basic Python programming tutorials for a non-programmer
	can be found <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">here</a>.
	</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>By the end of the course, students will have seen experience with
      many more advanced techniques which are vital to effective scientific
      research, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The basic syntax and use of Python as a scientific tool,
	including writing and executing scripts to automate common
	tasks, using the IPython interpreter for interactive exploration
	of data and code, and using the IPython notebook to share and
	collaborate.</li>
      <li>Loading data from a variety of common formats</li>
      <li>Manipulating data efficiently with NumPy</li>
      <li>Visualizing data with Matplotlib</li>
      <li>Performing more sophisticated data mining and machine learning
	analysis with Scipy and Scikit-learn</li>
      <li>Tracking changes and collaborating with
	<a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a></li>
      <li>Emphasis on how to use documentation and online resources to
	learn more</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <p>The overarching goal is for a student with little experience in
      computational research to be equipped to start working in any
      area of data-intensive research.  While a single quarter class could never
      provide every student experience with every computing tool they
      will encounter in graduate school, this course will lay a foundation
      from which new tools and techniques can be explored.</p>

    <h2>Credit and Grading</h2>
    <p>The seminar portion of this course is available for 1 pass/fail credit.
      In order to receive a pass, students must complete the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attend at least six of the nine weekly class meetings</li>
      <li>Turn in at least six of the nine weekly programming assignments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The assignments each week will be a chance to go deeper in the
      subject area covered, and to highlight coding practices that are
      useful for scientific research.  They are designed to take between
      one and two hours for a typical student with the background described
      above, though those with more experience will likely be able to finish
      much more quickly.</p>
